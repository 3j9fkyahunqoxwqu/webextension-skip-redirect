firefox-skip-redirect
=====================
Some web pages use intermediary pages before redirecting to a final page. This
add-on tries to extract the final url from the intermediary url and goes there
straight away if successful.

This add-on aims for similar functionality as the following add-ons but in a
simpler and/or better documented way:
[Redirect Bypasser](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/redirectbypasser/) /
[Redirect Remover](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/redirect-remover/) /
[RedirectCleaner](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/redirectcleaner/)

This add-on is developed using the [Mozilla Add-on
SDK](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK).
